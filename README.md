# Decentralized affiliate program on Waves blockchain
---
## Introduction
In order to attract new users to your product, the referral system and its more effective form, the affiliate program, have become very popular.
This program allows you to attract new users and pay rewards to both parties for helping to develop the project.

## Rewards payment rules

Affiliate program is multi-level and the distribution of rewards is as follows:
1. Referrer is constantly paid:
- percent from total bets amount of 1st level referral
- percent from total bets amount of 2nd level referral
- percent from total bets amount of 3rd level referral
2. Referral receives percent cashback, for the fulfillment of certain conditions.

### So, how does all this work?
 
Thatâ€™s simple!
 
1. First you need to log in using Waves Keeper and get your referral link.
2. Promote and advertise your referral link.
3. Make posts in any popular social networks and messengers in single click directly from the affiliate program interface.
4. Control your earnings, see analytics of your rewards growth as well as referrals activity.
Withdraw funds in single click to your Waves address.

Everything is fair and transparent!
The logic of work is controlled by a smart contract and all data is stored in Waves blockchain!
